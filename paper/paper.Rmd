<!-- the literature basically talks separately about anchor selection and DIF methods. much more literature is on DIF methods and less is on anchor selection. I'm basically writing a paper about anchor selection and just calling it DIF methods because that seems like where the action is. I'm taking fixed at that the likelihood ratio test is the way to go (and perhaps that deserves more detail)? -->

<!-- weird formatting that isn't apa I don't think and indentation is weird, solution is to use papaja (look at paper_apa.Rmd) or this might also be helpful https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4073674/how-to-disable-indentation-in-particular-section-in-latex-->

<!-- hopefully all of this below goes away with papaja and other solutions. but remember if it can't editing the latek file is always an option on the final draft!
